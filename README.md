## Welcome!

This tutorial walks you through the data-wrangling process with exercises and visualizations. We will be using data from the [**Great American Coffee Taste Test**](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2024/2024-05-14/readme.md), a nationwide coffee tasting initiative conducted by James Hoffmann and Cometeer in October 2023.

The **Great American Coffee Taste Test** is extremely exciting to me on the basis of the scale and efforts required to collect it's data. Over 5,000 kits were mailed to volunteers across the U.S. who blindly rated four coffees mysteriously labeled A, B, C, and D. While Hoffman's viewers may not represent the average American and their relationship with coffee (we can assume that his subscribers, for the most part, have a positive relationship with coffee as they are watching content on it for leisure), it's still still great data that could be useful for companies developing products for coffee enjoyers. In the case of an average Joe like me, it's just a good bit of fun to explore, and with it, I can offer some insight into foundational data-wrangling techniques. So, whether you are here for the data, coffee, or both, welcome!

Throughout this interactive learnr powered tutorial, we'll tidy messy survey data, reshape it into a form suitable for analysis, and use our clean and shaped data to generate visualizations. In doing so, we'll gain more insight into this question:

> **What can American coffee preferences tell us about their habits, personalities, and favorite brews?**
